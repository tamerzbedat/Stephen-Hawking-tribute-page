this is a Stephen Hawking tribute page

this is my first project ever, it's a tribute website about Stephen hawking.

this was a part of freecodecamp.org course I have been studying (this is day 13).

from hello world to a tribute website in less than 2 weeks, I am proud of myself :)

I have to say the codes are messy and parts of it I wasn't very clear to me, but I managed to get it how i wanted it to be.

you can see this project live at the following URL: https://tamerzbedat.github.io/Stephen-Hawking-tribute-page/

Enjoy!
